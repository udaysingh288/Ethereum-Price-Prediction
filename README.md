## Project Details:
This project is predicting the fluctuations of cryptocurrency Ethereum using the Twitter Sentiments and Reddit posts.
###### 1.Data Extraction
		- Ethereum pricing data (Timeline: September 28th,2017 to March 18th,2018) from Coinmarketcap API.
            - Tweets of the same timeline extracted using Tweepy and Textscraper libraries.
###### 2.Core Implementation
	We tested LSTM deep learning model first using historical prices to predict future prices of cryptocurrency. The predictions were not strong enough to predict the fluctuations in the price.

## Our Regression Model -
We tested our data on various Regression models including **Multiple Linear regression ,SVR and Random forest** and found the **most accurate results** in **Random Forest Regression** 
The predicted prices plot and statistics of the prediction have been included in the repository.
